# game-of-life

An implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), which provided a good opportunity to learn how to use classes in Python 3.

## How to use

It's best to run game-of-life.py in interactive mode. If your shell is set up like mine, the command will be something like:

`python3 -i game-of-life.py`
